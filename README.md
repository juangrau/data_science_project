Data Science Demo Project

Demo project objectives:
1. Build charts on hits for job posting website
2. The hits information must contain: source City/Country, date and time 
3. Enhance Job Postings with data from another job posting website (example: Glassdoor)
4. The Job postings must contain: City/Country, job title, skills

Solution - Part 1 and 2
As the first step, I needed to create a dataset with the information required, but as I have no access to this type of information, I build my own dataset. 

The script WebTrafficCreator.py available in this repository is in charge of creating the dataset
